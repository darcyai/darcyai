# Darcy AI Engine

Darcy AI Engine is a Python library that makes building AI apps as easy as building any
other type of app. AI Engine exposes high-level constructs (`InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Perceptor`, `Callback`)
that you assemble in a `Pipeline` with a few lines of Python.

To get started, see the [Build Guide](https://docs.darcy.ai/docs/guides/build/), or
the [Python reference docs](https://darcyai.github.io/darcyai/).
