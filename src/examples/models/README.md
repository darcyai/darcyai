# Example AI models

This directory contains additional Tensorflow AI models that you can use to build applications and try out examples. The models are:

- SSD multiple object identification
- Bird classification
- Face mask detection

Two of the models have different files for different processor situations. One is for use with the Google Coral AI accelerator and one is for use with a standard CPU. The face mask detection model does not require a different TensorFlow file for the different processors.
