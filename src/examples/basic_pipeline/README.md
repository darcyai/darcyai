# Basic Mock Perceptor Sample Application

This sample application is a good demonstration of the simplicity of the Darcy AI programming approach. It contains a mock Perceptor that can help you understand how Perceptors are built. It also has a sample input stream and sample output stream so you can see how those components operate.

## Run the example

Use this command to run the main Python file which is the application code:

```
python3 -u basic.py
```

## Expected results

The application should run successfully and continue running without producing any output. You can set a breakpoint within the code to watch the execution or you can add print or log statements to send the output to your terminal. The sample input stream in this example produces a text string "hello" periodically. Learn about how Darcy AI works by modifying the sample output stream callback code in the `basic.py` file to do something with the strings as they flow.
