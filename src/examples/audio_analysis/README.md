# Audio Analysis Sample Application

This sample application is a good example of a custom input stream and a custom perceptor working together to extend Darcy AI to process audio in real time.

## Run the example

Use this command to run the main Python file which is the application code:

```
python3 -u audio_analysis.py
```

The other files are the TensorFlow AI model, custom Perceptor, and custom Input Stream that make the application possible.

## Expected results
